# Navbar Refactor Plan

## 1. Current Issues
- The navbar line overlaps or visually clashes with the main content.
- Padding, alignment, or separation is insufficient.
- The navbar looks generic and lacks visual polish.

## 2. Goals
- Visually separate the navbar from the rest of the app.
- Improve spacing, alignment, and overall aesthetics.
- Make the navbar sticky (remains at the top on scroll) for better UX.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

## 3. Proposed Improvements
- Add a subtle box-shadow or bottom border to the navbar.
- Increase vertical and horizontal padding.
- Use flexbox for layout: app name left, nav links right.
- Ensure the navbar has a consistent background color.
- Make the navbar sticky on scroll (`sticky top-0 z-50` in Tailwind).
- Add hover/focus styles to nav links.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness (collapse or stack links if needed).

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Identify the navbar component/file.
2. Refactor the navbar structure with semantic HTML.
3. Apply Tailwind classes for spacing, background, shadow, and sticky positioning.
4. Adjust nav link styles for hover/focus.
5. Test on desktop and mobile.
6. Check for accessibility (aria-labels, contrast).
